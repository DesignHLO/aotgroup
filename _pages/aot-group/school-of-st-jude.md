needitnow.com.au, an online business of the AOT Group, is proud to support The School of St Jude in Arusha, Tanzania.

Opened by Australian Gemma Sisia in 2002 with just three students and one teacher, The School of St Jude is now a thriving institute for over 1,700 students and more than 500 local Tanzanian staff. 

Students from disadvantaged families are accepted from around Arusha, a city of over 1.4 million people located at the foothills of Mt Kilimanjaro and Mt. Meru.

The school operates two campuses and accepts 150 new Students in Year 1 each year. In 2015 the first Year 12 students will graduate at the school.

The school's philosophy of "Fighting Poverty through Education" is helping students break the cycle of poverty that has gripped their families for generations and provides a quality education in a country of over 45 million people with nominal GDP of US$703 per person.

With the assistance of all needitnow.com.au customers the AOT Group has donated over $180,000 to The School of St Jude so far.
