### AOT Hotels is the Accommodation Program Manager for the Australian Government

AOT is the officially appointed Accommodation Program Manager by the Department of Finance and Deregulation for the Australian Government to exclusively contract and make available all domestic accommodation over 100 Federal Agencies that are subject to the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997.

Under the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines, it is mandatory for those Agencies to use the Phase 2 coordinated procurement arrangements to book their domestic accommodation requirements through AOT either directly or through their appointed Phase 1 TMC.

The Australian Government has appointed AOT as the single accommodation program manager to provide travellers with an outstanding accommodation booking management service, ensure the best possible accommodation inventory is available Australia-wide, reduce accommodation supply costs, and ensure detailed transaction data and improved data analysis.

AOT Hotels achieves this by reducing the increasing complexity and costs to Government of obtaining quality accommodation by providing exceptionally competitive rates complemented by last-minute rates and seasonal specials, together with highly responsive accommodation and hotel based venue hire booking services.
