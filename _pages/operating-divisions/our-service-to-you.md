### Best Price Guarantee
Due to our volume buying power across Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific we maintain a very competitive pricing policy with all product suppliers to ensure we provide our partners with the best available rates. This now includes providing last-minute rates to our partners via our online booking engines.

AOT operates a Preferred Supplier Partners (PSP) scheme whereby we negotiate to provide preferential business levels in return for a best price guarantee. PSPs are carefully screened and are actively promoted and heavily supported by our worldwide partners.

### We have the largest product range / tariff
Our online tariff offers over 4,000 products across Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific, ranging from budget to five-star deluxe and this is tied to over 6,000 rooms a night available on year round allocations and 10,000+ rooms a night available on last-minute allocations. These tools, available on our trade only, password protected website, are invaluable for our clients to produce their brochures / websites and to instantly confirm bookings at the best possible price.

### We provide 24/7 on the ground assistance
AOT acknowledges that customer service on the ground is a major part of the overseas clients' experience and this is particularly relevant when there are several hours in time difference. For this reason, the AOT customer service toll free lines in Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

### We offer specialised foreign language products
As part of our extensive product range, we have a wide selection of foreign language tourism products across the regions. These products are targeting non English speaking passengers seeking a more personalized experience with commentary in their own language.

### Guaranteed availability through our extensive accommodation inventory
Due to the high volume of AOT partners' business to the suppliers, we are able to obtain year round availability through substantial room allocations also covering special events and high demand periods. We especially focus on the highly sought after sold out destinations such as Sydney, Melbourne, Auckland, Queenstown, Ayers Rock and Darwin, ensuring we provide our clients with adequate inventory to support their brochure products.

### We have a dedicated famils division & customer service area
At AOT we acknowledge the important role famils play in staff development and knowledge. For this reason we have a dedicated famil unit which takes care of all the logistics of famils for our worldwide partners. Be it an individual famil for a staff member or travel agent or a famil group, our experienced team will liaise with our supplier partners to ensure the best conditions are granted and the right balance between work and leisure is achieved.

This department also handles all customer service issues from refunds requests to complaints, and prides itself on impeccable and fast response service.

Our global customers include many of the world's leading wholesalers to the southern hemisphere, many of who have worked with AOT for over 20 years.
