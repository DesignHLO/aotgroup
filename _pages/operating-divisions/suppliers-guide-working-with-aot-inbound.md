AOT Inbound has proven experience in maintaining mutually beneficial distribution partnerships, around the world. We aim to provide the highest level of service to our trade partners and valued suppliers. Recognized as the regions leading Inbound Tour Operator, we place enormous emphasis on our partnerships with both our clients AND our suppliers.

### Suppliers
We take pride in offering travellers the most comprehensive range of tourism product across Australia, New Zealand and the South Pacific. We are always pleased to welcome new product suppliers who share our passion to provide outstanding holiday experiences in the region.

Our dedicated team of professionals in our Contracting & Product teams are always available to discuss how you can work with us. Following are some key guidelines for working with us.

### Deadlines
Our contracts are emailed directly to suppliers prior to ATE, TRENZ and BULA. As we work to strict deadlines when supplying product to our international clients, it is important that you take note of the return date for these. Failure to return your rates by the set deadlines may result in alternative products being selected.

*The “rate year” is April through to March*.

Please note that the selection process is determined mostly by the competitiveness of the rate in comparison to similar products meeting the clients' criteria for product mix and market requirements and does not guarantee overseas brochure inclusions.

### Rate Integrity
AOT Inbound places a lot of importance on the respect of the distribution network and it is crucial when supplying us with rates that you guarantee to have taken into account the important role of the Inbound Tour Operator in the distribution chain. Rates supplied to us which do not match this criteria, not only damage your reputation but also AOT's as well as the wholesalers selling your product.

If you are supplying rates directly to international wholesalers we ask that you ensure the industry standard “break” between those rates and the rates you supply to us. This will ensure we are able to provide our overseas clients with competitive rates in their marketplace.

### Allotments
In a world of instant “everything”, it is a requirement that we have the ability to sell a product with instant confirmation. Supplying us with an allotment or freesale status enables us to do just that. Your product is more likely to be sold if instant confirmation is available and we normally do not contract products which do not provide such facility.

Product updates
Please advise us immediately by email [product@aot.com.au](mailto:product@aot.com.au) of any changes to your product such as; name changes, renovations, closure, ownership changes, schedule or itinerary changes as well as any other amendments which our clients need to be aware of prior to travelling. We are legally bound to provide the most up-to-date and accurate information to our overseas partners.
